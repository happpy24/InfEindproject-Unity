- Saving does not work

### Project details
For our end of the year project we had to make a website or game.

The website had to be created with the dotnet 6.0 library and had to use at least 1 database.

The game had to use object orientated programming and be written in either p5.js or Unity (C#)

For our project we decided to make a Unity game.

### The plan
Make an short RPG with Turnbased combat

We started by making sure collision worked, and worked on the movement so that the player moved per 32x32 tile instead of inbetween them.

One of us went to work on making the Combat work, the others went to make sure the other elements worked (NPCs, map, ).

we did some other stuff here

some other stuff there

boom sudden project done

poggers (?)
